Making software at work usable. With Matterway we developed technology
that allows customers to build ergonomic applications on top of their
existing systems of record. And do that in a matter of days, not months.

I joined the company early on and helped define and implement the product.
By the time I left the company 30% of DAX companies were our customers or
doing pilots with us.
