I joined the company early on and helped define and implement the
product.

Our software allows customers to build usable apps on top of their
existing systems of record. Those apps would work both on Desktop and
Mobile platforms. Using our platform each app would take several hours to
several days to build, instead of months using traditional tools.

My role in the company evolved from a senior developer to a product
manager.

By the time I left the company 30% of DAX companies were our customers or
doing pilots with us.
