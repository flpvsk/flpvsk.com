Earlier this year Countess Prof. Michelle Cooley has released a book
titled "Vampire-centered design". The reception so far has been
overwhelmingly possitive. Our team at *The New Gothic* reached out to
Prof. Cooley to talk about their work, the book and how they approach
designing user interfaces.


*TNG:* Countess, thank you for doing this interview.

*Prof. Cooley:* My pleasure.

*TNG:* Could you tell us about your background?

*Prof. Cooley:* Sure. I got turned by a good friend, a respected vampire.
First couple of dozen years I helped out, working on their food business.
Then decided to get into academia. I got my Ph.D. in Architecture at
AlucardTech. Joined a design studio, became interested in digital tech,
worked on user interfaces ever since.
