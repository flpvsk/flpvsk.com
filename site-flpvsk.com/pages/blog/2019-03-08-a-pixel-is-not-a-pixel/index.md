Building graphical user interfaces always seemed unnecessarily hard to me.
So much so I even made a [podcast episode][code-ui-ep] about that topic.

One of the reasons why seems to be common across different kinds of
systems. It's not GUI-specific. That reason is poor API design.
Specifically poor balance of *control* vs *ease-of-use* over the space
of use cases.
